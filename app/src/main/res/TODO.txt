FINISHED (26/07/21) Change it so LibraryFragment doesnt call the player onCreateView, this stops the bug where if you go to another navigation page and go back to the library, the song resets.

FINISHED (28/07/21) Make sure that on reaching start of playlist, when pressing play it'll play the FIRST song of playlist
                    Make sure that on reaching the end of playlist, when pressing play it'll play the FIRST song.
                    Possible fix for this: Maybe make it so togglePlayPause checks if the boolean "endOfPlaylist / startOfPlaylist"
                    is true then if so prepare song 0.

FINISHED (29/07/21) Made it so the player spins the song with the rounded cover.
