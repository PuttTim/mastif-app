FINISHED Change it so LibraryFragment doesnt call the player onCreateView, this stops the bug where if you go to another navigation page and go back to the library, the song resets.

TODO Add Next/Prev functionality then hooray we have the *basic* app?

TODO Cleanup how QueueVM/PlayerVM works, mayybe skip QueueVM all together and use PlayerVM instead.
